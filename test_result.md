    message: "Backend testing completed successfully. All 4 critical tests passed: 1) Health endpoint via frontend proxy (port 3000) returns 200 with correct JSON and CORS headers, 2) Direct backend access (port 8001) works correctly, 3) Ingress prefix adherence verified (/health without /api returns 404), 4) Stability test passed with 10 consecutive successful requests. The minimal FastAPI service is fully functional and ready for frontend integration."
