    message: "Frontend UI testing completed. CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Authentication state is not persisting across page navigations. While demo login works correctly and redirects to dashboard, direct navigation to protected routes (/corkboard, /cases) redirects users back to login page. This indicates a session management issue in the AuthContext or routing logic. Core functionality of individual pages appears implemented correctly but is inaccessible due to auth routing problems."
