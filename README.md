## 🧠 Project Overview

**CrimeConnect FBI** is a visual investigation aid modeled after real-world FBI corkboards. This app allows users to:

- Add suspects, cases, and documents to a shared workspace
- Visually connect clues, leads, and evidence
- Mimic an investigation board experience digitally
- Manage data securely using a Supabase backend
- Enjoy a fast, reactive interface built with Vite, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI

This project is a creative experiment that blends crime investigation UX with modern web development — made entirely on **Lovable.io**.
